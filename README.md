# GPT-3 Command Prompt (GPTCP)

GPTCP is a Python-based command-line tool that integrates with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to assist users in executing tasks and obtaining intelligent responses. It interacts with GPT-3 through a chat interface, translates messages to command-line syntax, and safely executes approved commands.

## Features

- Communicates with GPT-3 through the chat.openai.com interface using Selenium WebDriver
- Supports syntax translations between different languages (e.g., Python, Bash)
- Implements a command approval process with a separate popup window for improved security
- Logs errors, warnings, and important information for better debugging and maintenance
- Well-organized project structure with separate modules for easier understanding and contribution
